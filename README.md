## CrewAI

The `crewai.ipynb` file runs through a tutorial for setting up an agent 2 agent conversation using `crewai` to organise the two agents and their processes. It also uses Serper to fetch the latest news. By no means is this supposed to be a "from scratch" attempt, but an outline as to what we should be attempting.
